## What can it do?

- It will track both prompt and negative prompt history for txt2img and img2img.
- It will allow a user to load the history stored on local storage. 
- It will allow a user to clear the prompt history.

## TODO
- Change the formatting of the local history to a singular instance using JSON to track steps.
- Put a max threshold on the prompt's history.
